Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: 
    person("Cathal", "Byrne", email = "cathal470@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides infrastructure for managing data definitions (ontologies) as 
    versioned, testable hypotheses rather than authoritative decrees. Supports 
    registering object types, defining concepts with SQL expressions, recording 
    audit judgments, detecting definition drift, and implementing evidence-based 
    governance. Designed to make disagreement measurable and prevent silent 
    definition lock-in.
