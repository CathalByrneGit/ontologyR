\description{
Provides ontologyIndex-style ergonomics (named list access, $ operator)
on top of the table-based storage. This gives you the best of both worlds:
\itemize{
\item Database as source of truth (versioning, audit trails, governance)
\item R-native feel with $ accessors and cached lookups
}
}
