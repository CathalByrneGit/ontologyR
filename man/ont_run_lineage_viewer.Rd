\item Source datasets: Gray database icons
\item Materialized datasets: Green diamonds
\item Derived datasets: Blue boxes
\item Transforms: Yellow squares
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Launch with default settings
ont_run_lineage_viewer()

# Launch pointing to a specific database
ont_run_lineage_viewer(db_path = "my_ontology.duckdb")
}
