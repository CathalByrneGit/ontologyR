\usage{
ont_sample_for_audit(
  concept_id,
  scope,
  version = NULL,
  n = 20,
  where = NULL,
  concept_value = TRUE,
  seed = NULL,
  con = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{concept_id}{Character. The concept to sample from.}

\item{scope}{Character. The scope.}

\item{version}{Integer. The version. If \code{NULL}, uses active version.}

\item{n}{Integer. Number of objects to sample.}

\item{where}{Character. Optional SQL WHERE clause to filter the sample
population (e.g., only sample from today's cases).}

\item{concept_value}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), only sample objects
where the concept evaluates to TRUE. Set to \code{FALSE} to sample
regardless of concept value, or \code{NA} to sample where concept is FALSE.}

\item{seed}{Integer. Random seed for reproducibility.}

\item{con}{A DBI connection. If \code{NULL}, uses the active connection.}
}
\value{
A tibble of sampled objects with their concept values.
}
\description{
Selects a random sample of objects that meet a concept definition for
human review. This is the foundation of drift detection: by regularly
auditing samples, you can detect when definitions diverge from reality.

ont_connect(":memory:")
# ... setup ...

# Sample 20 cases that the system says are "ready for discharge"
sample <- ont_sample_for_audit(
    concept_id = "ready_for_discharge",
    scope = "flow",
