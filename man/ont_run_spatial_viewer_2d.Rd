\title{Run 2D Spatial Viewer Shiny App (Leaflet)}
\usage{
ont_run_spatial_viewer_2d(db_path = NULL, launch.browser = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{db_path}{Character. Path to the DuckDB database file. If NULL, the app
will prompt for connection details.}

\item{launch.browser}{Logical. Whether to open the app in a browser.
Default TRUE.}
}
\value{
This function runs the Shiny app and does not return a value.

\description{
Launches an interactive Shiny application for visualizing ontology data
on a 2D Leaflet map. A lighter alternative to the CesiumJS 3D viewer that
doesn't require WebGL or external tokens.
}
\details{
The 2D Spatial Viewer provides:
\itemize{
\item Interactive 2D map powered by Leaflet
\item Multiple base map options (OpenStreetMap, CartoDB, Esri)
\item Point clustering for large datasets
\item Color objects by concept evaluation (TRUE/FALSE) or score value
\item Click features to see property details
\item Filter by spatial regions
\item Export data to GeoJSON
\item Linked table selection (click row to pan to point)
}

Before using, register geometry for your object types:
\code{ont_register_geometry("Asset", "point", lon_column = "lon", lat_column = "lat")}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Launch with default settings
ont_run_spatial_viewer_2d()

# Launch pointing to a specific database
ont_run_spatial_viewer_2d(db_path = "my_ontology.duckdb")
}

}
